	* Checksums.pm (makehashref): guarantee that a hashref is
	produced, and not a 0 (as could happen for empty CHECKSUMS files)

2005-01-23  Andreas Koenig  <andk@cpan.org>

	* Checksums.pm: Introducing $MIN_MTIME_CHECKSUMS and
	$IGNORE_MATCH. Should be fully backwards compatible.

2003-02-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Checking the return value of close and falling back to normal
	mode if it isn't success.

	* The released version 1.15 stupidly left in the fallback case the
	C< 0&&<<''; > in the resulting file. Version 1.16 corrected this.

	* Added optional GnuPG signing of CHECKSUMS files. Courtesy
	Autrijus Tang.

2002-10-06  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Turn off the generation of 8.3 filenames per default, keep it
	accessible with a global. Discourage its use.

	* Do not ignore symlinks anymore. Ignoring them is not the right
	policy: either forbid or list them in the CHECKSUMS file. Up to
	now a directory that contained only a symlink, remained without
	CHECKSUMS file, which is stupid and makes (unstoppable) noise in
	CPAN.pm.

	* drieux at wetware.com reports that the manpage is missing a
	prerequisites section. Added now.

2000-12-13  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Return 1 after deleting CHECKSUMS in an empty (or otherwise not
	indexed) directory. We used to return without argument.

2000-12-11  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Delete CHECKSUMS if directory is empty. 

	* Skip symlinks. Symlinks are considered inappropriate in CPAN
	author directories. They violate the principle of a one to one
	relationship between filename and file.

2000-12-10  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Releasing as 1.003
	
	* original version; created by h2xs 1.19
